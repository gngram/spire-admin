# 🌐 SPIRE Admin Web Console

SPIRE Admin Console is a secure administrative platform for managing [SPIRE](https://github.com/spiffe/spire) (SPIFFE Runtime Environment) deployments. As a remote web-based console, it provides centralized control and visibility over SPIRE Servers, SPIRE Agents, workload identities, trust authorities, and federation relationships across distributed environments.

The console enables administrators to configure registration entries, monitor agent attestation, inspect issued X.509-SVIDs and JWT-SVIDs, manage trust bundles, and establish workload federation between multiple SPIFFE trust domains. It also provides operational dashboards for server health, connected agents, active workloads, certificate rotation, federation status, and audit events.

By integrating strong authentication (mTLS, SPIFFE identities, or enterprise identity providers) with role-based authorization, the SPIRE Admin Console offers a secure and user-friendly control plane for operating large-scale zero-trust identity infrastructure.

## 🏗️ Architectural Overview

The SPIRE Admin Console runs as a **SPIFFE workload**. 
1. It connects to a local SPIRE Agent's Workload API socket (e.g., `agent.sock`).
2. It automatically and dynamically retrieves its own X.509 SVID (mTLS certificate and private key).
3. Using these SPIFFE credentials, it secures TLS connections to the remote SPIRE Servers' administration endpoints.
4. Once authenticated, administrators can execute commands, manage registrations, control agents, and rotate keys remotely.

### 🔗 Server Federation & Authorization Requirements

To allow the SPIRE Admin Console to remotely administer a SPIRE Server (e.g. `domain-a.test`), two main requirements must be satisfied in the target server's HCL configuration:

1. **SPIFFE ID Authorization (`admin_ids`)**:
   The remote SPIRE Server must explicitly authorize the admin workload's SPIFFE ID (`spiffe://admin.app/spire_admin`) to execute administrative gRPC APIs. This is done by adding the ID to the `admin_ids` array in the `server` block:
   ```hcl
   server {
       # ...
       admin_ids = ["spiffe://admin.app/spire_admin"]
   }
   ```

2. **Trust Federation (`federation`)**:
   The remote SPIRE Server must trust the root authority of the Admin Console's trust domain (`admin.app`) to establish mutual TLS (mTLS). This is configured in the server's `federation` block, defining how it retrieves the trust bundle for `admin.app` (typically over HTTPS):
   ```hcl
   server {
       # ...
       federation {
           federates_with "admin.app" {
               bundle_endpoint_url = "https://127.0.0.1:8445"
               bundle_endpoint_profile "https_spiffe" {
                   endpoint_spiffe_id = "spiffe://admin.app/spire/server"
               }
           }
       }
   }
   ```
   *(Refer to [docs/test_setup_guide.md](docs/test_setup_guide.md) and [test/spire_test_setup.sh](test/spire_test_setup.sh) for the complete multi-domain federation bootstrapping details).*

## 🔨 Building & Installation

### 1. Building on NixOS

This repository includes a [Nix Flake](flake.nix) providing a fully configured development shell with Go, GCC, SPIRE, and OpenSSL.

#### Enter the Nix Development Shell
```bash
nix develop
```

#### Build Commands in NixOS
Once inside the development shell, you can use the predefined shell alias or standard `go build`:
```bash
# Build Web Console
build-web-app
# Or:
go build -o spire-admin-web ./apps/spire-admin-web
```

---

### 2. Building on Ubuntu / Debian

#### Package Requirements (APT)
To build the Web Console on Ubuntu (20.04/22.04/24.04 LTS), install the following prerequisites:

```bash
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y \
  golang-go \
  gcc \
  pkg-config \
  openssl
```

> **Note**: If your distribution provides an older Go version, install Go 1.20+ from [golang.org](https://go.dev/dl/). Ensure [SPIRE](https://github.com/spiffe/spire/releases) (`spire-server` and `spire-agent`) is installed and available in your `PATH`.

## 🛠️ Getting Started & Local Testing

You can spin up a local SPIRE testing environment simulating an administrative domain and federated test domains to test the SPIRE Admin Console.

### 1. Start the Local SPIRE Testing Environment
The repository contains a script under [`test/spire_test_setup.sh`](test/spire_test_setup.sh) that sets up:
- **Admin Server** (`admin.app` at `127.0.0.1:8081`) and Agent.
- **Federated Server A** (`domain-a.test` at `127.0.0.1:8082`) and Agent.
- **Federated Server B** (`domain-b.test` at `127.0.0.1:8083`) and Agent.

Run the script providing a temporary directory for configuration and database files:
```bash
./test/spire_test_setup.sh /tmp/spire-data
```

*(See [docs/test_setup_guide.md](docs/test_setup_guide.md) for full CLI options including `--domain-a-server-port`, `--domain-b-server-port`, `--admin-server-port`, and `-c/--clean`).*

Keep this terminal running. It will output a summary showing the socket paths and ports once initialization is complete.

## 🌐 Running the Web Console

### 1. Generate SSL Certificates for HTTPS
Generate local HTTPS development certificates:
```bash
cd apps/spire-admin-web
./generate_certs.sh /tmp
cd ../..
```
This produces `cert.pem` and `key.pem` files under `/tmp/spire-certs/`.

### 2. Launch the Web Server
Run the web server by specifying the agent socket, SSL keys, and target port:
```bash
./spire-admin-web \
  -socket /tmp/spire-data/spire-admin/agent.sock \
  -cert /tmp/spire-certs/cert.pem \
  -key /tmp/spire-certs/key.pem \
  -port 8443
```

### 3. Log In as Administrator
Open your browser and navigate to `https://localhost:8443`.

#### 🔐 Default Credentials & Env Variables
By default, the server provisions a default administrator account:
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`

You can override these credentials before starting the web server by setting the `ADMIN_USERNAME` and `ADMIN_PASSWORD` environment variables:
```bash
export ADMIN_USERNAME="my_custom_admin"
export ADMIN_PASSWORD="my_secure_password"
./spire-admin-web \
  -socket /tmp/spire-data/spire-admin/agent.sock \
  -cert /tmp/spire-certs/cert.pem \
  -key /tmp/spire-certs/key.pem \
  -port 8443
```

#### 🛡️ HTTPS CA Certificate & Trust Setup
When connecting to the web server over HTTPS:
1. The web server expects the `-cert` and `-key` parameters to serve TLS traffic.
2. If self-signed certificates were generated (via `./generate_certs.sh`), browsers will display a connection warning. To establish a fully secure HTTPS connection, import the generated root CA certificate (`/tmp/spire-certs/rootCA.pem`) into your browser/system trust store, or use certificates issued by a trusted Certificate Authority.

Once logged in:
- Click the **User Manager** tab at the bottom left to create additional operator or administrator accounts.
- Under the **Servers** tab, add `Server 1`, `Domain A`, and `Domain B` using addresses `127.0.0.1` and ports `8081`, `8082`, `8083`.
